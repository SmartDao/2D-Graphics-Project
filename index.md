## Welcome to Strelok's Github Page

This page is currently under construction while I figure out how exactly github pages work.

I have recently completed my second year of games programming at AIE.

I have a little 2D graphics project that I am currently working on!

The following is the current state of my 2D graphics project.

As of 01/12/2021 I am trying to implement a "Chunk" rendering system also known as sprite batching. 
Essentially I would like to be able to render several sprites all neatly arranged into a block.

My current roadmap of features for the 2D graphics project is:
Sprite Batching
Animated Sprites

Sprite sorting (so that certain sprites render over the top of others)
Improve lighting (Occlusion and lightmaps)



I program mainly in C++ but I can also use C#, specifically the Unity scripting portion which I used to help create a game for an assignment. 
I'm more partial to C++ rather than C# generally.
I'm currently working with the latest version of OpenGL (4.5) and after completing my roadmap of the 2D graphics project I'd like to move onto Vulkan for more industry relevant skills/standards.


You can email me at vgozhyi@gmail.com if you're interested in my project or for general contact.
