## Welcome to Strelok's Github Page

This page is currently under construction while I figure out how exactly github pages work.

I am currently studying game programming at AIE (full course name unavailable as its really long and unnecessary)

I have a little 2D graphics project that I am not working on much, yet.

The following is the current state of my 2D graphics project.

My goal is to have a solid 2D graphics system, from which I will then move onto 3D.
And after that I'll move onto physics, then gameplay, then... well basically have a fully fledged game engine more or less.
This is mainly to develop my skills across the board in game development on the programming side, maybe after that I could take up art.

I program mainly in C++ but currently I'm using C# for my school project that I am doing at AIE.
