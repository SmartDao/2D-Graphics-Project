## Welcome to Strelok's Github Page

This page is currently under construction while I figure out how exactly github pages work.

I have recently completed my second year of games programming at AIE.

I have a little 2D graphics project that I've been working on.
The development of this project is postponed for now while I do an in-depth
study of C++.

The following is the current state of my 2D graphics project.

As of 23/02/2022 I am doing an in depth-study on C++ so I can have an easier time developing my graphics project.
(that and so I can understand why certain things aren't working).

The goals I'd like to reach in the 2D graphics project are:
Sprite Batching
Animated Sprites

Sprite sorting (so that certain sprites render over the top of others)
Improve lighting (Occlusion and lightmaps)

This is all after I've figured out how C++ works and how to use it properly.


I program mainly in C++ but I can also use C#, specifically the Unity scripting portion which I used to help create a game for an assignment. 
I'm more partial to C++ rather than C# generally.
I'm currently working with the latest version of OpenGL (4.5) and after completing my roadmap of the 2D graphics project I'd like to move onto Vulkan for more industry relevant skills/standards.


You can email me at vgozhyi@gmail.com if you're interested in my project or for general contact.
